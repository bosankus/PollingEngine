# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories to report privately:
- Go to the repository Security tab and click "Report a vulnerability".

If Security Advisories are not available, you can also contact the maintainers by opening a minimal issue asking to initiate a private security report. Do not include exploit details publicly.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 5 business days and will work with you to validate and address the issue.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest released minor version and apply critical fixes to the most recent patch releases as needed.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices. Once a fix is available, we will coordinate a public advisory and release notes in CHANGELOG.md.
